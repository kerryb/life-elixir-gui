# Life Gui

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

This is a very basic web GUI for a [simple implementation of Conway’s Game of
Life](https://github.com/kerryb/life-elixir), to demonstrate separation of
concerns between “business” and display logic.
